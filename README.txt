Git includes all 4 modules used in the course including Project files, Application files and any additional test files and support files for completing each module.

Also, this is my first personal utilization of GIT, GitHub and Tower 2.  Tower 2 has so far been a great GUI for the Git process.  It is not completely obvious what the various commands are which made me realize I needed to remember the Git commands from previous tutorials, however it does make it a lot more visually appealing and in the end user friendly.
